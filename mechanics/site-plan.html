      <h3>Learn the basics of automotive mechanics and improve your routine</h3>
      <p>Few are the drivers and vehicle owners who understand the basics of automotive mechanics and, 
        for this reason, do not adopt the proper care for the conservation of their car. 
        This type of situation, in practice, can cause a series of problems, such as premature damage 
        to the vehicle, sudden pans, in addition to increasing the risk of accidents.</p>
      <p>So, to avoid unpleasant and dangerous situations, it is essential to know a little more about 
        the operation and mechanics of a car. With that in mind, the purpose of this site will be to 
        teach some basic but very important notions. </p>

      <h3>Why is it important to know the basics of automotive mechanics?</h3>
      <p>Preventive vehicle maintenance is very important to avoid mechanical problems. 
        Without some essential care, no matter how new the car may be, failures can occur, 
        causing major headaches for its owner.</p>

      <p>In this sense, unwanted situations, such as difficulty starting the vehicle, 
        overheating or total battery failure can happen, and worst of all: when you least expect it.</p>
        
      <p>If problems like these cause problems with the car in the garage or close to home, 
        the situation is complicated when failures occur in the middle of traffic. 
        Or even, on a highway or in a moment of heavy rain. In addition to being stressful, 
        failures due to carelessness can be potentially dangerous â€” which reinforces the need 
        to always act preventively.</p>
      
      <h3>The basics avoid problems</h3>
      <p>Knowing the basics of how your car works will help you avoid these problems. 
        Whether it's your own day-to-day action, overhauling and replacing damaged items, or 
        improving your understanding of the automobile. With that, even if you don't want to get 
        your hands dirty, it will be possible to identify failures right at the beginning and give 
        more accurate diagnoses to the mechanics.</p>

      <h3>What are the necessary basic knowledge about car mechanics?</h3>
      <p>
        It's true that a car is a complex machine, full of tiny parts with weird names. 
        However, the logic of its operation is simple, as well as the engineering solutions to 
        certain problems that existed in the early days of the automotive industry.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, understanding the basics of vehicle mechanics is not difficult. 
        See, below, some explanations and learn how the main systems of a car operate.</p>
